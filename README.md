#  SQL for Backend Developers

A comprehensive SQL resource crafted specifically for backend engineers.

This repository goes beyond just writing queries ‚Äî it teaches you **how SQL works in real backend systems**, with a focus on schema design, performance tuning, and real-world data modeling. Whether you're preparing for interviews or scaling a production system, this repo has you covered.

## üìö Learning Tracks

###  [`/beginner/`](./beginner)
Fundamentals of SQL syntax and querying:
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET
- Filtering (`IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `NULL`)
- Aggregates & `GROUP BY` / `HAVING`
- Joins (INNER, LEFT), CASE WHEN, basic subqueries
- Combining results with `UNION`, basic math functions

###  [`/intermediate/`](./intermediate)
Core SQL for application logic and reporting:
- Advanced joins (RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, SELF)
- Subqueries: correlated vs non-correlated
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Conditional aggregation & filtering
- Date & string functions
- Window functions: `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LAG`, `LEAD`
- Type casting, NULL behavior, indexing
- Refactoring anti-patterns, performance pitfalls

###  [`/advanced/`](./advanced) *(Coming Soon)*
Deep dive into performance tuning, optimization, and system design:
- Query execution plans & optimization strategies
- Indexing, partitioning, clustering
- Materialized views, denormalization
- SQL in distributed systems
- Locking, concurrency, isolation levels
- Writing scalable, maintainable queries in real systems

## üèóÔ∏è System Design-Oriented SQL

### [`/schema-design/`](./schema-design)
How to design normalized, scalable, and flexible relational schemas that power real applications.

### [`/case-studies/`](./case-studies)
Hands-on SQL problems from actual backend systems ‚Äî how to approach, analyze, and optimize queries for production.
